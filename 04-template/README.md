# Template Method (behavioral pattern)

### Intent

Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

### Applicability

* The template method is useful when there are parts of an algorithm which remains invariant.
* Common behavior among subclasses. This helps to avoid duplication.
* Control of subclasses extension.
